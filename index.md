<li><b>In-class quiz (10%)</b>: One in-class quizzes. The questions will be simple. Mainly for checking the participation. The exact date are in the below <a href="#schedule_materials">schedule</a>.</li>
<li><b>Project (50%)</b>: A grading project. You should submit a proposal (10%) a final report (20%) and give a presentation (20%). </li>
</ul>

<b>Bonus (up to 2.5%)</b>: One additional scribing: 1%. <b>Pre-course survey</b> + <b>Post-lecture survey</b>: 0.3% for each, and the maximum is 1.5%. I do encourage you to complete all of them so that to let me know your feedback and adjust the course accordingly. Send your names to the TA. 


#### Scribing
Please sign <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KnBVwOY0zNKy_I34AC6GzPFyVbRk3rK5hk_NbzR4Zdw/edit?usp=sharing">Scribing preference</a>. We should have at least one student for each lecture. We may adjust the assignment if necessary. Notice that your note and scribing will be posted online, for others reference. You can choose to remove your name or not. Deadline for signing the scribing: **<span style="color:red;">11:59 pm on 19th Sep</span>**. After that, the Google sheet will be closed.

#### Projects
You should do the project individually. You should submit a proposal (10%), a final report (20%) and give a presentation (20%). <b>Both the lecturer (80%) and the students (20%) will be the markers</b>.

#### Late days
Each student will have <b>6 late days</b> to turn in scribing, project proposal, and project final report. A maximum of 2 late days can be used for each assignment. Grades will be deducted by 25% for each additional late day. 

#### Post-lecture survey
Deadline for each survey: **<span style="color:red;">11:59pm on the day before the next lecture</span>**. We do this because I could have time to answer the questions you mentioned in the survey. Please fill 1 in the Google sheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MXR6yEputJY6ZQLPdeWB4hzwMTOpAacOP2BQOZ_kuNs/edit?usp=sharing">Survey results</a>, once you have finished one survey. Usually, we will trust the 1s you fill in the Google sheet. But we will check the things in detail if the number of survey forms we received and the number of 1s on the Google sheet is not consistent.
